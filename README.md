# View-n-Save
A Photo Organizer

#WHY

This program was created to help organize my MANY photo folders. It was also great practice with C#, 

#WHAT

This repository contains all the files that was used to create the program, they are located in the aptly named "Source File" folder. In the "Executable" folder you will find the program itself, feel free to use it.

#HOW

Visual Studio 2019 was used to create this program. The code was written in C#.

To use the program, you click the "add" button to load images into the program. From there you can click on the thumbnails in the left container to then rename them using the text fields on the right, underneath the main picture. The first textbox is the name you wish to give the file, the second text box is the file extension you want it to have. Once you are satisfied, you can either change the directory you want to save to by clicking the "folder" button, or simply push the "save" button to save the file with its new name.
